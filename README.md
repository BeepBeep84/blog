# blog
This template is designed to be minimal, lightweight, and easy to adapt. If you’ve ever wanted to run a blog without dealing with WordPress or a complicated CMS, this is for you.

It’s built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses a simple posts.json file for the content. That means there’s no database, no build process, and no fuss - just drop it on a server and you’ve got a working blog.

Details on how to use can be found on the [preview blog](https://randomboo.com/blog/template/).
